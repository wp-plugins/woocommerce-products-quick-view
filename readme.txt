Add Quick View feature to all grid view products on shop, category, tag pages. Opens full product page content, add to cart without leaving the page
  
== Description ==

WooCommerce Quick View Ultimate gives your customers a true supermarket shopping experience. In a supermarket shoppers browse products on the shelves, picking up the ones they are interested up, reading all the relevant information and either adding the item to their cart or putting it back on the shelf and continuing to browser. You can now give your customer exactly the same experience with Quick View Ultimate.

While browsing products anywhere in your store - shop page / category pages / tag pages they see a products that interests them - instead of clicking 'More Details' and going to another page to view all the product information and images they click Quick View and see it all in a pop-up right there on their screen. This is the sequence

* See something of interest - Pick it up from the shelf (Open the product in the pop-up)
* View all the products information and make a buying decision
* Either add the item to the shopping basket (Add to Cart)
* Or put the item back on the shelf and continue to browse (close the pop-up)

It is quick easy and incredibly convenient for your customers and will create more sales.
